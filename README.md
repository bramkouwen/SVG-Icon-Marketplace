# Project Name
Icon Chest

## Project description
This project is my SVG-Icon-Marketplace homework assignment for my MMED-1055-01-22S Multimedia Authoring 2 class. For the assignment I have created a icon store called Icon Chest. I gave it a logo,a nav, and search bar. 
The icons I created are about musical instruments. There are twelve in total and they are all white and there is a hover feature on them so that they get a border when you move your mouse across them.
